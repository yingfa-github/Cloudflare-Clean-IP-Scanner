Many foreign websites are using Cloudflare CDN, but the IP assigned to visitors from mainland China is not friendly (high latency, high packet loss, and slow speed).  
While Cloudflare exposes all[IP segment](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/), but trying to find one that suits you among so many IPs would be exhausting, so I came up with this software.

**"Self-selected preferred IP" tests Cloudflare CDN latency and speed to obtain the fastest IP (IPv4+IPv6)**! If it's useful**Click`⭐`Give me some encouragement~**

# If the average latency is very low (e.g., 0.xx), it indicates that CloudflareScanner is using a proxy during the speed test. Please disable any proxy software before conducting the test.
# If running on a router, please disable any proxies within the router (or exclude them), otherwise the speed test results may be inaccurate/unusable.

# Because each speed test randomly selects an IP from each IP range, the results will vary each time, which is normal!

# Note! I found that after the computer boots up, the first speed test may have noticeably higher latency (manual TCPing is the same), but subsequent tests are normal.
# Therefore, it is recommended that before conducting the first official speed test after booting up, randomly test a few IPs (no need to wait for the latency test to complete, just close it once the progress bar moves).

# The entire process of the software under the default parameters:
# 1. Latency test (default TCPing mode, HTTPing mode requires manual addition of parameters)
# 2. Latency sorting (sorting latency from low to high and filtering according to conditions, different loss rates are sorted separately, so there may be some IPs with low latency but loss at the end)
# 3. Download speed test (starting from the IP with the lowest latency, downloading speed tests one by one, the default stops after testing 10)
# 4. Speed sorting (sorting speeds from high to low)
# 5. Output results (control whether to output to the command line with parameters (-p 0) or output to a file (-o ""))

# Note: The result file result.csv will display Chinese garbled characters when opened with Microsoft Excel, which is normal. It displays normally in other spreadsheet software/notepad.
```

The first line of the speed test result is**The fastest IP with the fastest download speed and lowest average latency**！

> People who are new to CloudflareScanner may be confused**There are obviously 30 IPs available for delay speed testing, so why are there only 3 left in the end?**  
> What does the queue in the download speed test mean? Do I still have to queue up when I download the speed test?

CloudflareScanner will first delay the speed test, during which the number of available IPs will be displayed in real time on the right side of the progress bar (`可用: 30`), but note that the available quantity refers to**Number of IPs that passed the test without timeout**, has nothing to do with the upper and lower limits of delay and packet loss conditions. When the delayed speed test is completed, because it is also specified**Delay upper and lower limits, packet loss**conditions, so after filtering according to the conditions, only`10`Already (that is, waiting for the download speed test)`队列：10`）。

That is, in the above example,`321`After the IP delay speed test is completed, only`30`Each IP test passes without timeout, and then according to the upper and lower limit range of delay:`40 ~ 150 ms`and packet loss upper limit conditions, only`10`There is an IP that meets the requirements. if you`-dd`If the download speed test is disabled, this will be output directly.`10`IP. Of course, this example is not disabled, so the software will continue to`10`IP for download speed test (`队列：10`）。

> Because the download speed test is a single-threaded one-by-one IP queue test, so the number of IPs waiting for the download speed test is called`队列`。

* * *

> You may have noticed,**It was clearly designated to find 5 IPs that meet the download speed conditions, but why was it "interrupted" after only 3?**

Download speed test progress bar`3 / 5`, the former refers to finding`3`IPs that meet the lower limit of download speed (that is, the download speed is higher than`1 MB/s`),the latter`5`Refers to your request to find`5`IPs that meet the lower limit of download speed (`-dn 5`）。

> Also, a reminder, if you specify`-dn`is larger than the download speed test queue. For example, after you delay the speed test, only`4`IP, then the numbers behind the download speed test progress bar will be the same as the download speed test queue.`4`one, not you`-dn`Specified`5`Already.

The software is finishing the speed test`10`After IPs, only`3`download speeds higher than`1 MB/s`of IPs, and the rest`7`Each IP is "failed".

Therefore, this is not`“每次测速都不到 5 就中断了”`, but all IPs have downloaded and tested the speed, but only found`3`one that meets the conditions.

* * *

If you don’t want to encounter this situation where few of the speed tests meet the conditions, then you have to**Lower the download speed limit parameter`-sl`**, or remove.

Because as long as you specify`-sl`parameters, then as long as there are not enough`-dn`number (default 10), the speed test will continue until enough or all speed tests are completed. Remove`-sl`and add`-dn 20`parameters, so that only the top 20 IPs with the lowest speed and delay are measured, and the speed measurement is stopped to save time.

* * *

In addition, if all queue IPs have been tested for speed, but there is no IP that meets the download speed conditions, then it will**Directly output the download speed test results of all queue IPs**, so that you can see the download speeds of these IPs, and you can know them in your mind, and then**Adjust it appropriately`-sl`try again**。

Similarly, in terms of delayed speed measurement,`可用: 30`、`队列：10`These two values ​​​​can also let you know whether the delay conditions you set are too harsh for you. If there are a lot of available IPs, but only 2 or 3 are left after conditional filtering, it goes without saying that you need**Adjust down expected latency/packet loss conditions**.

Of these two mechanisms, one tells you**Delayed packet loss conditions**Whether it is appropriate or not, one will tell you**Download speed conditions**Is it appropriate.

### Usage example

Windows To specify parameters you need to run in CMD, or add parameters to the shortcut target.

> **Notice**: Each parameter has**default value**, parameters using default values ​​can be omitted (**Choose as needed**),parameter**In no particular order**。  
> **hint**：Windows**PowerShell**Just put in the following command`CloudflareScanner.exe`Change to`.\CloudflareScanner.exe`That’s it.  
> **hint**: Linux system only needs to change the following command`CloudflareScanner.exe`Change to`./CloudflareScanner`That’s it.

#### #CMD runs CloudflareScanner with parameters

People who are not familiar with command line programs may not know how to run them with parameters, so I will briefly explain.

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

* * *

Many people open CMD to**absolute path**Running CloudflareScanner will report an error. This is because the default`-f ip.txt`The parameter is a relative path, and you need to specify the absolute path of ip.txt. However, this is too troublesome, so it is recommended to enter the CloudflareScanner program directory to**relative path**Run as:

**method one**：

1.  Open the directory where the CloudflareScanner program is located
2.  Press on blank space<kbd>Shift + right mouse button</kbd>Show right-click menu
3.  choose**\[Open command window here]**to open the CMD window, which will be located in the current directory by default.
4.  Enter a command with parameters, such as:`CloudflareScanner.exe -tll 50 -tl 200`Ready to run

**Method 2**：

1.  Open the directory where the CloudflareScanner program is located
2.  Select all directly in the folder address bar and enter`cmd`Press Enter to open the CMD window, which will be in the current directory by default.
3.  Enter a command with parameters, such as:`CloudflareScanner.exe -tll 50 -tl 200`Ready to run

> Of course, you can also open a CMD window at will and enter such as`cd /d "D:\Program Files\CloudflareScanner"`to enter the program directory

> **hint**: If using**PowerShell**Just put in the command`CloudflareScanner.exe`Change to`.\CloudflareScanner.exe`That’s it.

</details>

* * *

#### #Windows shortcut to run CloudflareScanner with parameters

If you don’t frequently modify the running parameters (for example, you usually just double-click to run), it is recommended to use the shortcut, which is more convenient.

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

* * *

Right click`CloudflareScanner.exe`document -**\[Create Shortcut]**, then right-click the shortcut -**\[Attributes]**, modify its**Target**：

```bash
# 如果要不输出结果文件，那么请加上 -o " "，引号里的是空格（没有空格会导致该参数被省略）。
D:\ABC\CloudflareScanner\CloudflareScanner.exe -n 500 -t 4 -dn 20 -dt 5 -o " "

# 如果文件路径包含引号，则需要把启动参数放在引号外面，记得引号和 - 之间有空格。
"D:\Program Files\CloudflareScanner\CloudflareScanner.exe" -n 500 -t 4 -dn 20 -dt 5 -o " "

# 注意！快捷方式 - 起始位置 不能是空的，否则就会因为绝对路径而找不到 ip.txt 文件
```

</details>

* * *

#### #IPv4/IPv6

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

* * *

```bash
# 指定自带的 IPv4 数据文件可测速这些 IPv4 地址（-f 默认值就是 ip.txt，所以该参数可省略）
CloudflareScanner.exe -f ip.txt

# 指定自带的 IPv6 数据文件可测速这些 IPv6 地址
# 另外，v2.1.0 版本后支持 IPv4+IPv6 混合测速并移除了 -ipv6 参数，因此一个文件内可以同时包含 IPv4+IPv6 地址
CloudflareScanner.exe -f ipv6.txt

# 也可以直接通过参数指定要测速的 IP
CloudflareScanner.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2606:4700::/32
```

> When measuring IPv6 speed, you may notice that the number of speed measurements is different each time. Learn the reason:[#120](https://github.com/Ptechgithub/CloudflareScanner/issues/120)  
> Because there are too many IPv6s (in billions), and most of the IP segments are not enabled at all, I only scanned some of the available IPv6 segments and wrote`ipv6.txt`In the file, those who are interested can scan for additions and deletions by themselves. The ASN data source comes from:[bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_prefixes6)

#### #HTTPing

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

* * *

There are currently two delayed speed measurement modes, namely**TCP protocol, HTTP protocol**。  
The TCP protocol takes less time, consumes less resources, and has a timeout of 1 second. This protocol is the default mode.  
The HTTP protocol is suitable for quickly testing whether a domain name is accessible when pointing to a certain IP. The timeout is 2 seconds.  
For the same IP, the delay obtained by pinging various protocols is generally:**ICMP &lt; TCP &lt; HTTP**, the further to the right, the more sensitive it is to network fluctuations such as packet loss.

> Note: HTTPing is essentially a**Network scan**behavior, so if you are running on a server, you need**Reduce concurrency**(`-n`), otherwise the service may be suspended by some strict merchants. If you encounter a situation where the number of available IPs in the first HTTPing speed test is normal, and subsequent speed tests are getting less and less or even directly to 0, but then recover after stopping for a period of time, it may be because the operator or Cloudflare CDN thinks you are scanning the network.**Trigger temporary restriction mechanism**, so it will recover after a while, it is recommended**Reduce concurrency**(`-n`) to reduce the occurrence of this situation.

> In addition, this software HTTPing only obtains**response headers**, and does not obtain the body content (that is, the URL file size does not affect the HTTPing test, but if you want to download the speed test, you still need a large file), similar to the curl -i function.

```bash
# 只需加上 -httping 参数即可切换到 HTTP 协议延迟测速模式
CloudflareScanner.exe -httping

# 软件会根据访问时网页返回的有效 HTTP 状态码来判断可用性（当然超时也算），默认对返回 200 301 302 这三个 HTTP 状态码的视为有效，可以手动指定认为有效的 HTTP 状态码，但只能指定一个（你需要提前确定测试地址正常情况下会返回哪个状态码）
CloudflareScanner.exe -httping -httping-code 200

# 通过 -url 参数来指定 HTTPing 测试地址（可以是任意网页 URL，不局限于具体文件地址）
CloudflareScanner.exe -httping -url https://cf.xiu2.xyz/url
# 如果你要 HTTPing 测试其他网站/CDN，那么指定一个该网站/使用该 CDN 的地址（因为软件默认地址是 Cloudflare 的，只能用于测试 Cloudflare 的 IP）

# 注意：如果测速地址为 HTTP 协议，记得加上 -tp 80（这个参数会影响 延迟测速/下载测速 时使用的端口）
# 同理，如果要测速 80 端口，那么也需要加上 -url 参数来指定一个 http:// 协议的地址才行（且该地址不会强制重定向至 HTTPS），如果是非 80 443 端口，那么需要确定该下载测速地址是否支持通过该端口访问。
CloudflareScanner.exe -httping -tp 80 -url http://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.webm

# 如果你想要测速非默认 443 的其他端口，则需要通过 -tp 参数指定（该参数会影响 延迟测速/下载测速 时使用的端口）

# 如果要延迟测速 80 端口+下载测速（如果 -dd 禁用了下载测速则不需要），那么还需要指定 http:// 协议的下载测速地址才行（且该地址不会强制重定向至 HTTPS，因为那样就变成 443 端口了）
CloudflareScanner.exe -tp 80 -url http://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5952/movie_max.webm

# 如果是非 80 443 的其他端口，那么需要确定你使用的下载测速地址是否支持通过该非标端口访问。

> Note: The delay speed test progress bar on the right**Quantity Available**, only refers to the delayed speed measurement process**Number of IPs that have not timed out**, regardless of the delay upper and lower bound conditions.

-   Specify only**[Average latency cap]**condition

```bash
# 平均延迟上限：200 ms，下载速度下限：0 MB/s
# 即找到平均延迟低于 200 ms 的 IP，然后再按延迟从低到高进行 10 次下载测速
CloudflareScanner.exe -tl 200
```

> if**No satisfying delay found**conditional IP, nothing will be output.

* * *

-   Specify only**[Average latency cap]**conditions, and**Only delay the speed test, do not download the speed test**

```bash
# 平均延迟上限：200 ms，下载速度下限：0 MB/s，数量：不知道多少 个
# 即只输出低于 200ms 的 IP，且不再下载测速（因为不再下载测速，所以 -dn 参数就无效了）
CloudflareScanner.exe -tl 200 -dd
```

-   Specify only**[Maximum packet loss probability]**condition

```bash
# 丢包几率上限：0.25
# 即找到丢包率低于等于 0.25 的 IP，范围 0.00~1.00，如果 -tlr 0 则代表过滤掉任何丢包的 IP
CloudflareScanner.exe -tlr 0.25
```

* * *

-   Specify only**[Download speed minimum]**condition

```bash
# 平均延迟上限：9999 ms，下载速度下限：5 MB/s，数量：10 个（可选）
# 即需要找到 10 个平均延迟低于 9999 ms 且下载速度高于 5 MB/s 的 IP 才会停止测速
CloudflareScanner.exe -sl 5 -dn 10
```

> if**Didn't find one that met the speed**conditional IP, then it will**Ignore conditions and output all IP speed test results**(This will help you adjust the conditions next time you test your speed).

> When the upper limit of average delay is not specified, if it has been**Not enough**The number of IPs that meet the conditions will**Always measuring speed**Go down.  
> So it is recommended**Specify at the same time[Download speed minimum]+[Average latency cap]**, so that the speed test will be terminated before the specified delay upper limit is reached before sufficient numbers are collected.

* * *

-   Specify at the same time**[Average latency cap]+[Download speed minimum]**condition

```bash
# 平均延迟上限、下载速度下限均支持小数（如 -sl 0.5）
# 平均延迟上限：200 ms，下载速度下限：5.6 MB/s，数量：10 个（可选）
# 即需要找到 10 个平均延迟低于 200 ms 且下载速度高于 5 .6MB/s 的 IP 才会停止测速
CloudflareScanner.exe -tl 200 -sl 5.6 -dn 10
```

> if**No satisfying delay found**conditional IP, nothing will be output.  
> if**Didn't find one that met the speed**IP of the condition, then all IP speed test results will be output regardless of the condition (convenient for you to adjust the conditions the next time you test the speed).  
> Therefore, it is recommended to test the speed without specifying conditions first to see what the average delay and download speed are, and avoid specifying conditions.**too low/too high**！

> Because the IP range exposed by Cloudflare is**Back-to-origin IP + Anycast IP**,and**Back to source IP**is unavailable, so the download speed test is 0.00.  
> You can add it at runtime`-sl 0.01`(lower limit of download speed), filter out**Back to source IP**(Results of download speed test below 0.01MB/s).

#### #Test the speed of one or multiple IPs individually

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

**method one**:
Directly specify the IP segment data to be measured through parameters.

```bash
# 先进入 CloudflareScanner 所在目录，然后运行：
# Windows 系统（在 CMD 中运行）
CloudflareScanner.exe -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32

# Linux 系统
./CloudflareScanner -ip 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/24,2606:4700::/32
```

* * *

**Method 2**:
Or write these IPs into any text file in the following format, for example:`1.txt`

    1.1.1.1
    1.1.1.200
    1.0.0.1/24
    2606:4700::/32

> You can omit it for a single IP`/32`subnet masked (i.e.`1.1.1.1`Equivalent to`1.1.1.1/32`）。  
> subnet mask`/24`Refers to the last segment of this IP, that is`1.0.0.1~1.0.0.255`。

Then add startup parameters when running CloudflareScanner`-f 1.txt`to specify the IP segment data file.

```bash
# 先进入 CloudflareScanner 所在目录，然后运行：
# Windows 系统（在 CMD 中运行）
CloudflareScanner.exe -f 1.txt

# Linux 系统
./CloudflareScanner -f 1.txt

# 对于 1.0.0.1/24 这样的 IP 段只会随机最后一段（1.0.0.1~255），如果要测速该 IP 段中的所有 IP，请加上 -allip 参数。
```

## Manual compilation

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Click to expand view content 」</strong></code></summary>

* * *

For convenience, I write the version number into the version variable in the code when compiling, so when you compile manually, you need to add it as follows:`go build`Add after the command`-ldflags`Parameter to specify the version number:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
# 在 CloudflareScanner 目录中通过命令行（例如 CMD、Bat 脚本）运行该命令，即可编译一个可在和当前设备同样系统、位数、架构的环境下运行的二进制程序（Go 会自动检测你的系统位数、架构）且版本号为 v2.3.3
```

If you want to compile under Windows 64-bit system**Other systems, architectures, bits**, then you need to specify**GOOS**and**GOARCH**variable.

For example, under Windows system, compile a program suitable for**Linux system amd architecture 64 bit**Binary program for:

```bat
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
```

For example, under Linux system, compile a program suitable for**Windows system amd architecture 32 bit**Binary program for:

```bash
GOOS=windows
GOARCH=386
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v2.3.3"
```

> Can run`go tool dist list`to see which combinations the current Go version supports compiling.

* * *

Of course, in order to facilitate batch compilation, I will specifically specify a variable as the version number, and subsequent compilations can directly call the version number variable.  
At the same time, if you want to compile in batches, you need to put them in different folders (or the file names are different). You need to add`-o`Parameters specified.

```bat
:: Windows 系统下是这样：
SET version=v2.3.3
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o Releases\CloudflareScanner_linux_amd64\CloudflareScanner -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=%version%"
```

```bash
# Linux 系统下是这样：
version=v2.3.3
GOOS=windows
GOARCH=386
go build -o Releases/CloudflareScanner_windows_386/CloudflareScanner.exe -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=${version}"
```
